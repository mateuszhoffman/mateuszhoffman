## Hi, I'm Mateusz 👋

I've been working with technology for a while - web development, industrial IoT cloud platforms, built and led engineering teams at ABB, some writing and speaking mixed in.

These days I'm working at Hitachi Energy as a Global IT Manager responsible for leading, fast-tracking and IT innovations in areas of artificial intelligence, extended reality, and autonomous mobile robots.

Personally I'm passionate about AI and extended reality - exploring new tools and large language models, but also playing around with machine learning and data analysis. I'm curious how these systems work underneath, so I build agents, RAG systems, and experiment with different approaches. Sometimes coding from scratch to understand the foundations, sometimes using no-code tools to move quickly.
