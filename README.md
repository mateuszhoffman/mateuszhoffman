## Hi, I'm Mateusz 👋

I've been working with technology for a while - web development, industrial IoT cloud platforms, built and led engineering teams at ABB, some writing and speaking mixed in.

These days I'm working at Hitachi Energy as a Global IT Manager responsible for fast-tracking IT Innovations in areas of Artificial Intelligence, Extended Reality, and Autonomous Mobile Robots.

Outside of my core role, I focus heavily on Generative AI - working with LLMs, designing agent-based systems, building RAG pipelines, and experimenting with various ML approaches. I enjoy going deep into system mechanics and balancing foundational implementation with rapid prototyping.
