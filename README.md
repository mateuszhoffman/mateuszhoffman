## Hi, I'm Mateusz 👋

I've been working with technology for a while - web development, industrial IoT cloud platforms, built and led engineering teams at ABB, some writing and speaking mixed in.

These days I'm at Hitachi Energy leading innovation services globally, spending most of my time with artificial intelligence and machine learning. 

**What I'm curious about:**
- How AI systems work underneath (not just using them)
- Building agents and RAG systems
- Experimenting with different approaches - sometimes coding from scratch to understand the foundations, sometimes using no-code tools to move quickly
