### Hi, I'm Mateusz 👋

I've been working with technology for a while - web development, industrial IoT cloud platforms, 
built and led engineering teams at ABB, some writing and speaking mixed in.

These days I'm at Hitachi Energy leading innovation services globally, spending most of my time 
with artificial intelligence and machine learning. I'm curious how these systems work underneath - so 
I build agents, RAG systems, try different approaches. Sometimes coding from scratch to understand 
the foundations, sometimes using no-code tools to move quickly.
